## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
A 120mm by 120 mm by 8 mm thick piece. it has 5 holes, one in each corner and one larger one in the middle.

### Reflection
it was very easy because all we had to do was add a line and extrude. I learned that you can make shortcuts that do the same thing, just faster.

## Fork

### Description
8in thick base, 75in forks  w/ 10in wide holes, 65in handle.

### Reflection
it was very easy, but I had a little trouble with the mirror on the forks. I couldn't find the plane to mirror over.

### Reflection
I learned about the revolve tool and more about construction lines.

## Wheel

### Description
it is a revolve of a sketch. it is 80 mms tall, 20 mms wide.

### Reflection
I learned more about the Circular pattern. it is cool that you can do however many you want.

### Reflection
it was kind of simple. I did have fun doing the mirror, though, because I have gotten better at it
